# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅ Full support    |
| tags    | ⚠️ Reported case-by-case |

Security fixes are applied to `main` and cherry-picked into active release branches when necessary. Older, unsupported versions might receive best-effort guidance but no guarantees.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public issues for potential vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. Email `security@nucleo-originario.dev` with the details, or open a private GitHub Security Advisory for this repository.
2. Include reproduction steps, impact assessment, and any relevant logs.
3. Encrypt communications if desired; we can provide a PGP key on request.

The maintainers will acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and aim to provide a remediation plan or status update within **10 business days**. Once a fix is available, we coordinate disclosure with the reporter before publishing release notes or advisories.

Thank you for helping keep the Metanúcleo ecosystem secure.  If you have questions about this policy, contact `security@nucleo-originario.dev`.
